-Details Activity don't care which articles it opens from it just loop on all articles
- monitor article content to see if the problem appears again (maybe solved with
setPageChangedListener)
- remember to rebuild data base and uncomment contentFetched,webarchive,published_date
- dialog don't appear again after one fails in details fragment
- fetching articles when Details Mode some time fetching fails
